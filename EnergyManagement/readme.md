# Energy Management

## Manage Energy, Not Time

### Activities that help me relax:
- Sitting calmly without doing anything.
- Using my mobile phone.

I notice that I get stressed when I can't finish my work or don't understand something after spending more than 4-5 hours on it.

I feel excited when I enjoy the work I'm doing or when I successfully finish a task.
